This NVDA add-on provides various commands for copying the text under the
review cursor to the clipboard. Currently, the following commands are
implemented:

* Copy the line under the review cursor

* Copy from the start of the current line to the review cursor
* Copy from the review cursor to the end of the current line
* Copy from the start of the current word to the review cursor

category. More information about setting and modifying input gestures can be
